Introduction:
                              --------------------------------------------------
This repository is a collection of small source files that may be used in other
projects. They range in complexity from trivial one liners such as 'exit_vz' to
more complicated utilities such as 'gen_vz'. Please see the individual files for
descriptions of operation.

Through lack of creativity, I have just given the files single word names that
are related to what they do. I've appended '_vz' (my initials), in order to
avoid potential conflicts when the files are included in other projects.
